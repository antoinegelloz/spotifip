# Spotifip - FIP Radio Companion

Spotifip is a fun and simple website for keeping up with what's playing on my favorite French radio station, FIP. It's a laid-back place where you can catch the vibe of FIP's playlist and even listen to a sneak peek of the tracks using Spotify. Plus, if you hear something you really dig, you can add it to your liked songs on Spotify with just a click.

## What's in the Mix

Spotifip isn't loaded with features, but it's got the essentials:

- **What's on air?**: Keeping you updated in real-time with the tracks FIP is spinning.

- **Spotify Grooves**: Hear a snippet of a song on Spotify and decide if it's your jam. If it is, save it to your Spotify liked songs with just one click.

## The Behind-the-Scenes Jam

Let's break down how Spotifip works:

### Backstage

- **Go**: A trusty Go microservice is the engine running the show. It hangs out on my personal VPS and does all the behind-the-scenes work.

- **Supabase**: I stash away the tunes details in an amazing Supabase project. It's like my secret stash of musical treasures.

- **Spotify API**: To find the tunes and get those Spotify links, we tap into the magical Spotify API.

### What You See

Our frontend is all about keeping it simple:

- **Vanilla JS**: It's the plain and simple JavaScript flavor that powers our frontend, ensuring quick loading and smooth interaction.

- **Supabase Connection**: We've hooked up with the Supabase JS client to fetch the data and bring it to your screen.

## How to Get the Groove
